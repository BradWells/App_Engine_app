    <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>Iowa State has impacted my life and my future career quite dramatically.  As I prepare to leave, I wanted to reflect on the different aspects of Iowa State and how it got me to where I am now.</p>

        <h3>Short Term Goal</h3>
            <p>My short term goal after Iowa State will be to contribute as much as I can to the company I work for after I graduate, Union Pacific Railroad.  I will be learning their processes, languages, frameworks, and connecting to my new team.  I want to continue to strive for high quality work, even though I am a new developer on their team.</p>
        <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
            <p>After a few years, I hope to eventually become a software architect.  I have always liked designing software systems on a whiteboard and detailing how modules can connect, and showing people the big picture.  Becoming a software architect would allow me to do just that, every day on the job.</p>
        <h3>General Education and Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>At Iowa State, in addition to my technical classes, I also enrolled in several general elective courses.  Taking these courses has broadened my perspective on how people think, and what problems exist around the world.  In my time at Iowa State, I have taken a course in Social Problems of the United states, where the class looked critically at the biggest issues facing our country.  I also took a current events and a world politics course, which taught me about what is going on in the world around me and that I need to think wider than the issues just facing my own country.  When combining general education with technical courses, you gain a fuller picture of the what the world is like and what problems need to be solved.</p>

        <h3>ISU as Preperation for the Workplace</h3>
            <p>ISU has prepared me for a real-world career in numerous ways.  To start, ISU's courses are designed to reflect the real world.  Teams of developers are formed, and participate in group projects.  Many of these projects are carried from start to finish.  We use the same version control products, the same methodology, and the same techniques as actual employers use.  In addition, our classes require us to either clearly define our requirements, or in some cases gather them ourselves from clients.  Projects are modeled as closely as they can to an actual development environment.</p>
            <p>There are many different ways that I have prepared myself for my future career while at ISU.  First, I took many group classes to learn my role on a team.  In some, I was also in the leadership position.  I learned how to manage people, arrange meetings and requirements, and keep on schedule.  I also learned about new issues in software development by discussing them with friends, learning from professors, or searching the web.  Finally, I learned about both professional and ethical responsibilities from the career fair and from ISU's technical writing class and ethics class.</p>
        <h3>Learning to Learn</h3>
            <p>At my time at ISU, one of the most important ideas that has been cemented in my head was the notion that I will always learn, even after I graduate.  At ISU, I have learned to use many tools to just start this learning.  I talk to my friends about the newest up-and-coming technology, I search online sites and blogs to find out the best solutions to common problems, and I browse scholarly journals to find out the newest discoveries being made in the field of software engineering.</p>
            <p>Specifically, to hone my skills I have been learning new languages like ruby.  I have also dabbled in new technologies like the Raspberry Pi and in bluetooth connections.  I also am branching out into new fields of study, like security and embedded systems.  The more areas I learn about, the less of a risk a completely new project is, because I have more experience to compare it to.  The more information I learn, the more confident I become.</p>
        <h3>Organizations and Clubs</h3>

        <h3>If I could do it over</h3>
            <p>One last thing I wanted to share was what I would change about my education if I could do my undergraduate degree all over again.  I think the most important thing I would change is that I would take classes to learn, not to get a good grade.  In my freshman and sophmore years, especially, I took many of my classes with the mindset that I needed to get good grades to get a good GPA.  Instead of trying to learn the material to apply it later, I just crammed the material for a test and soon forgot it.  This not only led to forgetfulness when my future courses built upon previous information, but it also avoided the entire point of what classes should be for: to gain knowledge for the future.  Universities teach information that you will use again, so keep that in mind whenever you take a course.</p>
